# 2D-Array Board-Game [Command-Line]
A 2D array board game that plays through the command line. 
This game contains basic functionality that allows players to attack or move based on their location on the grid.

Actions can only be taken by entering the corresponding number relating to that action. 
So if "(1)Up" is an available action then 1 is the input to the command line and not Up. 

This is a very basic game. The first i've created. It may contain errors, any bugs that are found please contact me. Thank you!
